                    manufacturing waste compared to traditional methods like injection-moulding. And the plastic we do

                    Nope! Don't try it, it'll go badly. PLA has a fairly low (180˚C) melting point, and anything above
                    about 50˚ is enough to soften it. If you need to clean our products, give them a quick rinse and

                    Short answer: Yep!
                    <br>
                    Long answer: Technically it's really insecure, but that's fine. Okay, so basically, this website
                    you're looking at right now is served by <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages">GitHub Pages</a>
                    over HTTPS, which is about as secure as your bank. The reason I haven't put much effort into making
                    this site safe is because it has access to zero personal information. It's sectioned off from the
                    rest of the business by a handful of Stripe's security protocols. All this site does is show you
                    some products and tell your computer to remember which ones are in your cart. Then, when you enter
                    the checkout, this website tells your computer to go to Stripe's (extremely secure) checkout page
                    and tell it your cart. This website is like a sketchy salesperson in the middle of a store, there to
                    tell you where everything is, but you wouldn't want to give them your credit card. Then you walk
                    over to the checkout which is guarded by two burly security guards (Stripe). Then, once you place
                    your order, the guards walk out to the back of the store and tell me what you ordered, but they
                    don't give me your credit card.
                    <br>
                    So no, this site isn't very secure. But it's totally secure for what it's doing (showing you
                    around the store). When you actually place an order, that site is probably more secure than the
                    Pentagon.

                    Nope! The way this site is set up, there's actually no way for me to track what you're clicking on.
                    In the checkout, you might see Stripe reccomending you some similar products, but that info's not
                    linked to you. If you place an order, I am able to see who placed it and what other orders they've
                    placed, but that's the only "tracking" we do.
