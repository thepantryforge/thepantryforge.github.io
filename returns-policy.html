    <h1>Returns, Refunds & Exchanges Policy</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        This policy covers returns, refunds and exchanges for all purchases made from The Pantry Forge, and is
        applicable to all products we sell.
    </p>
    <p>
        All goods and services we provide are subject to Australian Consumer Law (ACL) guarantees. This Returns, Refunds
        & Exchanges Policy (Policy) operates in addition to your rights under the ACL. Nothing in this Policy is
        intended to exclude, restrict, or modify any statutory rights or remedies available to you under ACL.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Policy is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and New South Wales.
    </p>

    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Return</strong>: The process of returning a product to us for assessment where a customer believes
            the product does not comply with the Australian Consumer Law, or where a return is permitted under this
            Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Refund</strong>: A repayment of the amount paid for a product, provided where required under the
            Australian Consumer Law (including for a major failure), or otherwise in accordance with this Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Exchange</strong>: The replacement of a product with the same or a comparable product, where
            permitted under this Policy or as a remedy available under the Australian Consumer Law, subject to
            availability.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Faulty or Defective</strong>: A product that does not meet the consumer guarantees under the
            Australian Consumer Law, including but not limited to where it is unsafe, not of acceptable quality, not fit
            for purpose, or does not match its description, and where the issue is not caused by misuse, accidental
            damage, or normal wear and tear.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Change of Mind</strong>: A return request made where a product is not faulty and complies with the
            Australian Consumer Law, but the customer decides they no longer want the product, have ordered incorrectly,
            or no longer require it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Unused, Original Condition</strong>: A product that has not been used beyond what is reasonably
            necessary to assess it, and is returned in a condition consistent with reasonable consumer inspection,
            including with original packaging, labels, and seals where practicable.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Proof of Purchase</strong>: Reasonable evidence that a product was purchased from us, as recognised
            under the Australian Consumer Law, including a receipt, invoice, order confirmation, or transaction record.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Store Credit</strong>: A credit issued for future purchases, offered at our discretion where
            permitted by law, and which does not replace or limit any refund entitlement required under the Australian
            Consumer Law.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Services</strong>: Any services supplied by us within the meaning of the Australian Consumer Law,

            <strong>Custom</strong>, <strong>Made-to-Order</strong>, or <strong>Personalised Items</strong>: Products

            consumer guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law still apply to such products.

    </ul>

    <h3>Your Rights</h3>
    <p>
        Under Australian law, consumers have a set of rights when buying products that cannot be revoked. For
        information on your rights, see the
        <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/buying-products-and-services/consumer-rights-and-guarantees">ACCC
            website</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        By law, you are entitled to these rights. We cannot overrule these rights through policy. This Policy operates
        in conjunction with ACL. Note that ACL does not require businesses to provide Change of Mind Returns or
        Exchanges.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Rights</h3>
    <p>
        We maintain the right to refuse service of suspected excessive or fraudulent Returns. Should you abuse this
        Policy, your right to return products will be limited to the extent permitted by ACL. Should you continue abuse,
        we will take further action to reduce your ability to engage with our store.
    </p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to update, modify, or replace this Policy at any time without prior notice. Continued
        use of our Services after any changes are published constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy. Changes are
        effective from the date of publication.

        the item back for repair. Should you choose an Exchange, we will provide free shipping for the replacement item.
        Should you choose a Refund, Exchange or Store Credit, you will be able to keep the item, dispose of it, or

    <p>
        Repairs and Exchanges may not be available due to low supply. If this is the case, we will contact you and
        provide you with other options.
    </p>

    <h3>Exchanges</h3>
    <p>
        If you enact a Change of Mind Return or the product is faulty, damaged or incorrect, and you choose to Exchange
        the product, you can choose any other item from our online store providing it meets the following criteria:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The new item is available for purchase at the time of the Exchange.</li>
        <li>
            The new item is the same product as the bought item. Note that it can be a different variant, e.g. size,
            colour.
        </li>
        <li>
            The price of the new item at the time of exchange is equal to the price of the bought item at the time of
            purchase. (If you want another product that is a different price, request a Refund or Store Credit.)
        </li>
    </ul>

        <li>PayPal</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We are able to provide a partial refund. Timeframes on refunds will depend on the payment method, so we will
        inform you of this at the time of Refund.
    </p>

    <h3>Store Credit</h3>
    <p>
        Store Credit is non-transferrable and non-refundable. It is issued in the form of an electronic gift card, to be
        used in our online store. It may include an expiry period.

    <h3>The Return Process</h3>
    <p>
        Start by <a href="contact">contacting us</a> with your personal details, your order details, and the reason you
        would like to return the product. We will contact you with information regarding eligibility, return address and
        payments.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you live outside of Australia, there may be difficulty in arranging a Return, Repair or Exchange. Whilst we
        strive to deliver the best experience possible, we may not be able to issue you a full Refund.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you return an item, please make sure to package it securely. If the item is damaged in transit, you may not
        be eligible for reimbursements. Ideally, use the original packaging.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we determine your item is not eiligible for return, we will return it to you at your cost, or provide you
        with a partial Refund.
