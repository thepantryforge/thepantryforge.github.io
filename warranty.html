    <h3>Australian Consumer Law Compliance</h3>
    <p>
        Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a
        replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage.
        You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and
        the failure does not amount to a major failure.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Rights</h3>
    <p>
        To the extent permitted by law, we take no responsibility for any loss or damage to our products during any
        stage of their life cycle, or for managing claims of warranty or return.
    </p>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to update, modify, or replace this warranty at any time without prior notice. Continued
        use of our Services after any changes are published constitutes acceptance of the updated warranty. Changes are
        effective from the date of publication, and affect only purchases made on or after the publishing date.
